# MQ2ChatEvents

## Description

**MQ2ChatEvents** The purpose of this plugin is to handle chat events in various ways. When a string \(and optionally a corresponding color\) is matched, several possible actions can be taken. Events are defined in the .ini file and can be enabled per character\_server. I've used this as a general replacement for in-game macros, Audio Triggers, and even some tasks I wanted available outside of a running MQ macro. I realize there are other plugins that do these various pieces individually, but I liked the idea of having it all under one configuration. Parts of the code were pieced together from other plugins and I tried to give credit where appropriate.

You can find the latest version of MQ2ChatEvents [here](https://macroquest.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=18906&hilit=mq2chatevents).

## Features

Match strings and perform an event

`Play a sound`  
`Up to 100 different matchable strings per event`  
`Use in-game variables in matchable strings`  
`Handy for generating custom voice sound files:`[`http://www2.research.att.com/~ttsweb/tts/demo.php`](http://www2.research.att.com/~ttsweb/tts/demo.php)  
`Display a popup`  
`Define popup text, including the full text of the matched string`  
`Define popup color`  
`Define popup duration`  
`Execute Commands`  
`Up to 100 commands per event`  
`Use in-game variables in commands.`  
`One command executed per pulse`  
`Display chat that gets lost while zoning`

This information used to be seen by OnIncomingChat\(\) even though it was not displayed to the screen by the client. At that time, the messages could be captured and then printed after zoning was complete. Unfortunately, it looks like those messages are no longer seen by OnIncomingChat\(\) --- It's amazing that SOE has never fixed this. I left the functionality in the plugin, but turned the default options off since it no longer works as it originally did.

`Commands : Toggles executing custom commands`
