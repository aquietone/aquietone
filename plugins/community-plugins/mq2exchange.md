# MQ2Exchange

## Description

**MQ2Exchange**, by Wassup, allows you to exchange items or unequip items without having any inventory windows or bags opened.

The thread where this plugin began can be found in the VIP forums [here](https://macroquest.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=7603). The current code being maintained by pms can be found [here](https://macroquest.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=152499#p152499).

## Commands

* **/exchange \[itemname\|itemID\] \[slotname\|slotnumber\]**

This exchanges the _itemname/itemID_ into the _slotname/slotnumber_ you define \(see [Slot Names](../../reference/general/slot-names.md) for names/numbers\). If there is an item in that slot already, it will be placed in the first available inventory/bag slot that is of sufficient size for the item.

**Note:** Item names that contain spaces must be enclosed in quotation marks, otherwise quotations marks are not required.

* **/unequip \[slotname\|slotnumber\]**

Unequips the item at _slotname/slotnumber_.

## Examples

The following two examples will exchange Staff of Eternal Flames to the mainhand slot:

`/exchange "staff of eternal flames" mainhand`  
`/exchange 24789 13`

The following two examples will unequip the item in your offhand slot:

`/unequip offhand`  
`/unequip 14`

* **/exchange list** gives a list of the equipment slot names and slot numbers.
* **/exchange help** gives a list of the commands available.
