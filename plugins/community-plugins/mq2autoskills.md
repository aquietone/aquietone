# MQ2AutoSkills

## Description

MQ2AutoSkills, developed by Cr4zyb4rd, is a plugin that attempts to use combat or other skills whenever they're available \(and the pre-requisite conditions are met\). It also has the ability to turn off attack during ENRAGE or Infuriate.

Currently supported skills are:

* Backstab
* Bash
* Begging
* Disarm
* Dragon Punch
* Eagle Strike
* Flying Kick
* Frenzy
* Evade
* Forage
* Feign Death
* Intimidation

* Pick Pockets
* Round Kick
* Sense Traps
* Slam
* Taunt
* Tiger Claw

The plugin can be downloaded from [here](https://macroquest.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=9079).

'**'Note:** This plugin was developed many years ago and has been superceded by other more fully-featured plugins, the most popular being [MQ2Melee](mq2melee.md).
