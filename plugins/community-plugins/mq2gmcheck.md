# MQ2GMCheck

## Description

**MQ2GMCheck** Created by Bushdaka

Check to see if a GM is in the zone. This is not fool proof. It is absolutely true that a GM could be right in front of you and you'd never know it. This plugin will simply find those who are in the zone and not gm-invis, or who just came into the zone and were not gm-invised at the time. If a GM comes into the zone already gm-invised, we will not know about that.
