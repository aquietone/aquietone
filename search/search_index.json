Refer to the MacroQuest TLO Docs to find the TLO member you are interested in displaying. For example, maybe you want to show Me.Height . Once you know the TLO member, the next step is to define a property for it. On the Config tab, expand Properties and select Add New Property . Enter the TLO member as the property name, Me.Height in the case of this example. After defining a property, a new column must be defined to describe how that property should be displayed. On the Config tab, expand Columns and select Add New Column . Enter a name for the column, such as Height . Select the property Me.Height to be displayed for all classes. Set a Threshold value of 2 . This will cause the column to display toons with a height greater than 2 in red , and toons shorter than 2 in green . The next step is to add the new column to a tab. It can be a new tab or one of the existing tabs. For the example, we will add a new tab called Height . On the Config tab, expand Tabs and select Add New Tab . Enter the name Height for the tab and add the Height column, then click save. Finally, add the new Height tab to the default window. On the Config tab, expand Windows and select Default . Click the Edit button and add the new Height tab, then click save. At this point, the default BoxHUD window should be showing the new tab which displays a column with the height of each of your characters.","title":"BoxHUD"},{"location":"boxhud/#boxhud","text":"View Repo View on RedGuides Download A HUD which uses DanNet to display box information.","title":"BoxHUD"},{"location":"boxhud/#overview","text":"This Lua script provides an alternative to a similar MQ2HUD/MQ2NetBots based HUDs.

Refer to the MacroQuest TLO Docs to find the TLO member you are interested in displaying. For example, maybe you want to show Me.Height . Once you know the TLO member, the next step is to define a property for it. On the Config tab, expand Properties and select Add New Property . Enter the TLO member as the property name, Me.Height in the case of this example. After defining a property, a new column must be defined to describe how that property should be displayed. On the Config tab, expand Columns and select Add New Column . Enter a name for the column, such as Height . Select the property Me.Height to be displayed for all classes. Set a Threshold value of 2 . This will cause the column to display toons with a height greater than 2 in red , and toons shorter than 2 in green . The next step is to add the new column to a tab. It can be a new tab or one of the existing tabs. For the example, we will add a new tab called Height . On the Config tab, expand Tabs and select Add New Tab . Enter the name Height for the tab and add the Height column, then click save. Finally, add the new Height tab to the default window. On the Config tab, expand Windows and select Default . Click the Edit button and add the new Height tab, then click save. At this point, the default BoxHUD window should be showing the new tab which displays a column with the height of each of your characters.","title":"Adding a new property to the HUD"},{"location":"boxhud/commands/","text":"Commands \u00b6 /lua run boxhud -- Start the script /lua stop boxhud -- End the script /boxhud -- Toggle the UI window /bhadmin anon -- Toggle anon mode (swap names with class in name column)","title":"Commands"},{"location":"boxhud/commands/#commands","text":"/lua run boxhud -- Start the script /lua stop boxhud -- End the script /boxhud -- Toggle the UI window /bhadmin anon -- Toggle anon mode (swap names with class in name column)","title":"Commands"},{"location":"boxhud/faq/","text":"FAQ \u00b6 Q. Why can't lfs.dll be found when starting the script? A. If the script errors loading lfs.dll , then you may need to install the VC Redist package from Microsoft Q. What builds does this run on? A. Currently this only works on MQ for live and test. Q. Boxhud fails to start with error Could not find script at path C A. Make sure you downloaded the resource and added the files to your lua folder Q. Why are buttons not responding or the window can't be moved around? A. Most likely a bug with ImGui and mouse inputs, and it thinks a mouse button is stuck pressed. Cycle through clicking all the buttons on your mouse. Q. Why are values not updating properly for one or more characters? A. Crashes, going LD, relogging, etc seem to screw up DanNet observers sometimes, and they don't appear to be removed properly or don't get added back properly when the character comes back online. Either go to the Admin tab on boxhud and reload the observers for the misbehaving character or reload the dannet plugin on the character running boxhud and it should hopefully fix the issue. Q. Can boxhud be launched at startup? A. To Run the script at login for a given character: If you don't already have a character config file for the character which will run boxhud, create a file in your next/config folder like servername_Charactername.cfg , for example, rizlona_Aquietone.cfg Add the following line to the file: /timed 100 /lua run boxhud Q. Why does boxhud cause characters macros to throw errors about undefined variables? A. By default, Boxhud will observe each configured property on all characters. Observing a property which doesn't exist on a character, for example, observing CWTN.Mode on a Bard, will cause undefined variable errors when trying to run a macro on the Bard. To avoid this, filters should be applied to the property to define which characters the property should be observed for. For example, when adding the property CWTN.Mode, the DependsOnName and DependsOnValue fields can be set to restrict what classes CWTN.Mode will be observed for: Property: CWTN.Mode DependsOnName: Me.Class.ShortName DependsOnValue: clr,shm,war,shd,mnk,rog,ber Note that the observer is created from the character that is running boxhud, so if your driver toon is running boxhud and trying to observe CWTN.Mode on the bard, you would need to fix the property on boxhud on your driver toon to not observe the property for bards. Q. Why does boxhud still cause characters macros to throw errors about undefined variables even after limiting what classes the property applies to? A. If you swap toons, like going from an enchanter to a bard on the same account, DanNet still seems to think its trying to watch whatever properties it was watching before you swapped characters. Boxhud on your driver toon doesn't know you swapped toons on some other account to try and resolve it for you automatically. Try reloading the dannet plugin on the swapped character. Q. Should anything and everything be added to boxhud? A. Try to just add vital information that is frequently updated. No need to go adding a bunch of static info about characters that will rarely ever change.

Overview \u00b6 Lua Event Manager is intended to provide an alternative to mq2events , mq2react and one-off lua scripts being written for events. Rather than events with giant, difficult to read macro if statements, easy to read lua functions can be written to handle events instead. Rather than reacts with a YAML file that frequently gets corrupted or breaks from indentation mistakes, more complex conditions and actions can be implemented. Event definitions are global and stored in a shared lem/settings.lua file. Editing events from multiple characters can overwrite changes if you aren't reloading before making edits on a character. Event enabled/disabled state is stored per character in a characters own lem/characters/{name}.lua file. Hopefully this allows to more safely enable or disable events across characters. Installation \u00b6 Manual Install \u00b6 Clone the repo or download the zip file linked above. Move lem.lua and the lem folder into the MQ lua folder. RedGuides Launcher \u00b6 Navigate to the Lua Event Manager resource page and click the Watch button on the Overview tab. Open the RedGuides Launcher and install Lua Event Manager from the Lua tab. Commands: \u00b6 /lua run lem -- Start the script /lem [help] -- display help output /lem event <eventname> - toggle text event enabled/disabled /lem cond <eventname> - toggle condition event enabled/disabled /lem show - show the UI /lem hide - hide the UI /lem reload - reload the script (currently by just restarting the script) Defining Event Categories \u00b6 Categories provide a way to group up events, to help keep the text and condition events sections organized. Several example categories are pre-defined, and more can be added or removed from the Categories section. Managing Events \u00b6 The Text Events and Condition Events sections provide controls for adding, editing and deleting events. The event list can be filtered by name to help find the event you are looking for. Full details of an event can be viewed by double clicking the row in the events table or clicking the View Event button. Editing Event Code \u00b6 All event implementations are saved to individual lua files in /lua/lem/events or /lua/lem/conditions . Editing the code in an external text editor like Visual Studio Code is recommended over using the text box in LEM, as it can provide several development features that make life writing code much easier. Import/Export \u00b6 To enable sharing of events between users, events can be imported and exported to/from LEM. Exporting Events \u00b6 Exporting events is done by right clicking an event in the event list and clicking Export in the context menu that appears, or by clicking the Export button in the event viewer. A base64 encoded string will be copied to the clipboard when you click Export . This will look like a long string of letters and numbers. Importing Events \u00b6 On the left hand side of LEM, select Import . Use the Paste from clipboard button to paste the base64 encoded string of the event you wish to import, and then click Import . This will open the imported event in the Add Event window, which you can then save into your event library.","title":"Event Manager"},{"location":"lem/#event-manager","text":"View Repo View on RedGuides Download A weakauras-like take on text based events (like MQ2Events ) and condition based events (like MQ2React ).","title":"Event Manager"},{"location":"lem/#overview","text":"Lua Event Manager is intended to provide an alternative to mq2events , mq2react and one-off lua scripts being written for events.

Autostart Lua Scripts \u00b6 For ALL Characters: \u00b6 Right click your MQ tray icon in the taskbar and select Open Folder > Config Create a new file ingame.cfg , or open it if you already have one. Add the line /lua run scriptname where scriptname is the script you want to run, such as boxhud or lem . Save and close the file. Test in game by running /loadcfg ingame.cfg or by logging in a character. For a SPECIFIC Character: \u00b6 Right click your MQ tray icon in the taskbar and select Open Folder > Config Create a new file server_Character.cfg , or open it if you already have one, where server is replaced with your EQ server short name, and Character is replaced with your character name. For example, rizlona_Dudebro.cfg . Add the line /lua run scriptname where scriptname is the script you want to run, such as maui or luabard . Save and close the file. Test in game by running /loadcfg server_Character.cfg or log in the character. NOTE: If you created ingame.cfg or server_Character.cfg using Notepad , like by right clicking in your config folder and selecting New > Text Document , then the file was probably saved with the wrong file extension, like ingame.cfg.txt .

For example: Buffs1 = Wand of Frozen Modulation|Summon|Wand of Restless Modulation|1|ME BuffsCond1 = TRUE MAUI breaks this line up into 3 pieces of information: Name -- Everything up to the first pipe ( | ), which is typically the spell or item name.In the example above, Wand of Frozen Modulation . Options -- Everything which comes after the first pipe ( | ). In the example above, Summon|Wand of Restless Modulation|1|ME . Conditions -- The entire condition entry. In the example above, TRUE . In addition to typing in a value for the name, you can right click the icon in the list and navigate spells, discs and AAs from the context menu. Right clicking an icon in something like DPS or Buffs list will give a menu of available spells, AAs, discs to choose from: Upgrading Spells \u00b6 When viewing the details of a list entry, an upgrade button will be displayed if it is determined that you have a stronger version of the spell memorized. The logic for detecting stronger spells is far from perfect, so it might be wrong a lot of the time. Similarly, downgrades will be suggested. This is in case you imported an INI which is above your level, and includes spells which you don't have memorized yet. Raw INI Editor \u00b6 The INI file can still be edited directly through the Raw INI tab. Importing KissAssist INI Files \u00b6 MAUI can import KA INI files and convert them to MA INI files. This has only been tested with a limited number of KA12 INI files, so YMMV. It works like so: Place the KA INI you wish to import into your MQ config folder. On the Import KA INI section, enter the file name (no file explorer, it must be typed manually/pasted in) Click Import All keys which are common to both KA and MA will be copied over to the resulting MA INI. Any keys which are KA or MA specific will not be set.
