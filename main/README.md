# Getting Started

## MacroQuest

Check out MacroQuest [here](https://docs.macroquest.org/) if you are interested in building it for yourself, otherwise head to [RedGuides](https://redguides.com) for a more streamlined experience.

## Lua Scripts

MacroQuest added support for [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) scripts as an alternative to the existing macro scripting language. In addition to all the capabilities available to macros, these also have the ability to use [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to create new UI windows to go with the scripts.
