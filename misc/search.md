# Search

Similar to the find item window, the Search window uses DanNet to search for a specified item across your peers and allows to request the item from a given toon.  

It can optionally search in toons banks, but by default only searches their bags.  

The request button will only work when the toon is within trading distance of you.  

It does not do any sort of checking for no trade, lore, etc., and will just attempt to trade the item.

It will not attempt to request an item that is in someones bank.
